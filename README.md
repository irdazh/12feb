### Why did I name this 12feb?
No sure. 

Anyway, trying to connect this to kaggle notebook, and versa. 

Some:

  - use kaggle notebook for a nice look
  - change into script, then commit to git, maybe (?)
  - download ipynb, add file to git, a nice look, again
  - well, it's online!
 
## Actually
On a second note, it's pretty hard (?) Probably because I'm not tech-savvy LOL. Or not at all? Well that's that.
